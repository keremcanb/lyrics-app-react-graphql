# Lyrics App React GraphQL Webpack

A simple lyrics app for practicing GraphQL & Webpack. The original version was very old, I completely refactored it using Apollo Hooks.

Libraries used for the front end are React, React Router, React Apollo, GraphQL Tag

Libraries used for the back end are Express, Mongoose, GraphQL, Webpack
