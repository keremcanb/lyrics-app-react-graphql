# Lyrics App React GraphQL Webpack

A simple lyrics app for practicing GraphQL & Webpack. The original version was very old, I completely refactored it using Apollo Hooks.

Libraries used for the front end are React, React Router, Apollo Client, React Materialize, Webpack

Libraries used for the back end are Express, Apollo Server Express, Mongoose
